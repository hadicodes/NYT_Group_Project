# NYT_Group_Project

### Update (April 13, 2017) this is an earlier project. This was an introduction to coordinating with others to work on a Github repo. It is incomplete. For a completed NYT app, check out [NYT React Search](https://github.com/hadicodes/NYT-React-Search). P.S. It also uses React, which is awesome.
